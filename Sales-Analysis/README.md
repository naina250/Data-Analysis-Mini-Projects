## Sales Analysis (Python)

This is a Sales Analysis Mini Project which I did using Python in Jupyter Notebook, to identify product-wise sales.

## What I Did

- First, I import the libraries 
- Then, Loaded and explored the dataset
- Cleaned the data and perform basic analysis
- Visualized the data using matplotlib and seaborn
- Find the key insights

## Insights

- Chocolate Cake and Truffle are leading in sales. 
- Brownie, Vanilla Cupcake and Choco Chip Cookie are the least-selling products.
- To increase the least-selling product sales, we suggest to offer combos(Chocolate Cake+Cookies) for cross-selling.
